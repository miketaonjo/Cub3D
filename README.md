# Project name : cub3D

For this project, the assignment is : 

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

Made with school graphical library : the MiniLibX.

We must create our own maps in .cub format and we can create our own textures in .xpm format.

<code>W</code>: move forward<br>
<code>S</code>: move backward<br>
<code>A</code>: strafe left<br>
<code>D</code>: strafe right<br>
<code>←</code>: rotate left<br>
<code>→</code>: rotate right<br>
